\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    This project represents a Modbus implementation in 100% Java.
    It can be used to implement Modbus masters and slaves in various flavors:

    * Serial: ASCII, RTU (Master only), BIN
    * IP: TCP, UDP

    The design of this library is fully object oriented, based on abstractions which should support easy understanding,
    reusability and extensibility.

    One important goal of this project is a codebase that is easily usable on a variety of Java Platforms (and devices).
    Many limited resource devices do not provide Java 5 and Java 6 environments, and there are only limited
    possibilities for logging.

    You might be looking at an offline copy. The last release version of this documents can be found at
    (http://jamod.sourceforge.net). However, as the online version will reflect the latest release version,
    it might be better to browse the local version that came with the release you are using.
